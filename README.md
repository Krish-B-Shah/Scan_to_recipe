Project: Scan To Recipe
Contributors: Krish Shah, Andrew Vu, Sivan Pushpagiri, Jovon Alexis

## Inspiration
Food waste is one of the biggest epidemics in the world, yet the cause of this is even more tragic. Food ends up in the trash not because of malice, but due to **lack of motivation** and **knowledge** in how to use them. This is what _Scan To Recipe_ aims to fix.

## What It Does
_Scan To Go_ is a website that scans random ingredients a user may have. When the user is done, the website will generate different recipes based on ingredients.

## How We Built it
We first created spent time creating the website, adding the different pages we wanted and how we wanted it took. We then had to access the user's camera, so it could snap a picture and analyze the picture for any food. After this is finished, we collect the detected items and recipes are generated.

## Challenges We Ran Into
This **biggest** challenge we had was finding a way to scan/detect objects. We tried using combinations of AI, pre-trained AR models, and different APIs in order to do it, but it didn't turn out as we hoped. We eventually ended up using manually inputting ingredients for the model to look for, and it ended up working to our liking.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
Getting the scan to actually work. It was the hardest part about this project, and definitely took the longest. While it doesn't do all that we imagined, it get its job done. Considering this is all of our team's first hackathon, we're very proud.

## What We Learned
How to use teamwork to our advantage, specifically divide and conquer. We also learned that research is very important to get anything done, as there were times where we were lost. We also realized that it's better to plan things out, rather than just dive straight in when an idea comes.
